# seattle_chicago_ds_051120

Welcome to the Flatiron Data Science Bootcamp.  We are so excited to lead you through this expansive journey.  We will update this repo with links to your lecture and warmup material. <br><br>
Maintaining a well organized project directory is an important part of data science. To start practicing your organization, create a directory somewhere on your computer (probably in the top level of ~/Documents) where you will clone the forked versions of the lecture repos.  It could perhaps look like the structure below.
```
chi_sea_ds
├── module_1/ 
│   ├── week_1/ 
│   ├── week_2/ 
│   └── week_3/ 
├── module_2/ 
│   ├── week_4/ 
│   ├── week_5/ 
│   └── week_6/ 
├── module_3/ 
│   ├── week_7/ 
│   ├── week_8/ 
│   └── week_9/ 
├── module_4/ 
│   ├── week_10/    
│   ├── week_11/ 
│   └── week_12/ 
└── module_5/ 
    ├── week_13/ 
    ├── week_14/ 
    └── week_15/ 
```

How you want to interact with the repositories is also up to you, but we suggest to fork each repo onto your personal github account, then clone the forked version onto your local computer. Once you have cloned the fork, you may want to set the upstream remote to the original.

`
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git
` 

Once you have run the above command, run:

`
git remote -v
`

You should see two remotes, the origin pointing towards your forked repo, and an upstream pointing towards the original.

> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)<br>
> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)<br>
> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)<br>
> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (pull)<br>

This way, you can make changes to the notebooks on your local computer, then push your changes to your fork.  

**Quick note:** When creating your repo structure, do not initialize or clone reposistories within folders that are themselves git repos.
